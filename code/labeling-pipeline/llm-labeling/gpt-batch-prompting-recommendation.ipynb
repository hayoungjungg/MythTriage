Thus, the video supports the myth. Videos urging people to adopt the \"mentality\" to quit illicit opioids or accusing them of wanting to \"stay in their addiction\" should be marked as supporting, as they subtly imply that individuals who lack willpower or moral responsibility are vulnerable to addiction and will continue having OUD.\\n\\nEXAMPLE 2 starts here ****:\\nVIDEO_TITLE: \"The Kratom Gals LIVE | Kratom Gets You High?

years old and I live on the black feet reservation in Browning Montana what completes me is my kids I love my kids so much but I don\\'t get to see them or spend time with them all the time because my daughter Jocelyn lives with my mother and thunder lives with my aunt and my uncle and I currently live with my boyfriend Brandon at his mother\\'s house love you baby she can\\'t live with her kids because my daughter Janelle is addicted to Suboxone Janelle isn\\'t working so she gets money any way that she can she asks her aunts and uncles and cousins and relatives for money she steals from people she\\'s stolen from her own children she sells her food stamps so she I don\\'t know how they eat you can actually see the outline of her skull her chest everything you can see every bone in her body Janelle if she don\\'t get help she\\'s gonna die let\\'s put it that way I\\'ll I\\'ll be I\\'ll be truthful she\\'s gonna die when Janelle and I were younger we were really close we hung out all the time we did Sports together we did everything together we just lived a good life and we were part of a running program so we went places we traveled a lot we did a lot of family things when Janelle was nine my husband and I decided to move to Missoula where there were more opportunities for all of us things went well for us for a few months but then my husband and I we started partying there was a lot of fighting going on because of the partying my dad started treating my mom differently than in one day they got into a fight and he left and he he didn\\'t come home so I ended up moving back to the reservation with my children and when I was out and continued to use I did anything from marijuana to crystal meth my dad was out of the picture and my mom would go out and sometimes be gone for days so my family helped raise my children until I was not using any drugs he was the love of her life she was just happy probably about four months into our relationship I found out I was pregnant satana and Janelle were really focusing on their family and getting ready for the baby and you know they wanted to leave Browning at first I didn\\'t agree with it because of her age but Janelle loved him she really loved him I got up to the hospital everyone was in there except sutana my first intention was to figure out you know what happened and if everybody was okay every time the door would open she would look and I knew I knew I knew that she was waiting for him to walk in they had hit right on his side and it pinned him in and he broke his neck so he died on on impact she just like lost everything right then and she just didn\\'t know what to do the nurses told us they said Janelle won\\'t eat she won\\'t do anything the first time I ever loved somebody somebody I cared so much about and they were now they\\'re gone so it just it\\'s just hard I mean I love him I always love him I miss him so much after Joss was born Janelle started partying drinking leaving a lot then it kind of just escalated from there I started doing Suboxone and meth my family took care of Jocelyn they make sure she was fed dressed everything and Janelle\\'s huge shits got worse how could you bring another baby into this world knowing that you have another child that you can\\'t and won\\'t take care of Thunder was born addicted to Suboxone he had to go through something no little baby should have to go through and Janelle kept leaving him to go get high [Music] we thought it was going to be for maybe a month or two but Janelle wasn\\'t meeting the criteria the state set for her [Music] thank you baby when I first met Brandon I was using and he was clean at the time it took like maybe two months before we started using together he doesn\\'t want my daughter to get better I think when she\\'s sick he controls her and that\\'s what he wants house keys [Music] they\\'ve just texted they\\'re on their way and Brandon is insisted that he come with [Music] just so you know they\\'re they\\'re about two minutes out okay you can stay here they\\'re coming out [Music] Janelle you\\'re my baby girl and despite everything that we\\'ve been through I have never ever stopped loving you you have no idea of the pain I feel when I see you walk away from your daughter or the aftermath of her crying and saying I want to know it\\'s time to come back now you have been gone too long and I will not bury you most importantly this is an opportunity for both of us to change [Music] so what do you say Janelle you ready to go I need to smoke a cigarette okay here yeah I\\'m talking for myself oh my God put this on why why would you even do something like that he\\'s walking away okay you\\'re going to treatment yes [Music] to see my daughter it was very very exciting a little bit overwhelming oh you just gotta try if you want it you can get it\"\\nVIDEO_TAGS: \"\\'a&e\\', \\'aetv\\', \\'a&e tv\\', \\'ae\\', \\'a&e television\\', \\'a&e shows\\', \\'a

that\\'s why the pens are\\nthere\\num now you\\'ve been writing songs since\\nyou were very little\\num what was the first song that you\\nwrote and what inspired you to write it\\nwell I\\'ve started writing songs when I\\nwas 12. okay and um quite an achievement\\nthanks uh I started writing songs when\\nthe guy who came over to fix my computer\\nhad a guitar with him because he had\\njust come from a show and he asked me if\\nI wanted to learn a few guitar chords\\nand I said yeah so he taught me three\\nguitar chords and um left his guitar\\nwith me that week and I wrote my first\\nsong wow you don\\'t get that from it\\nsupport in the UK it\\'s an incredible\\nservice okay everyone has to fix your\\ncomputer and talk your guitar absolutely\\nbrilliant definitely there\\'s just so\\nmany purposes for that you know guy who\\ncame to fix my computer the computer was\\nfixed and also like I\\'ve you know found\\nwhat I wanted to do with the rest of my\\nlife which is a wonderful thing what was\\nwhat inspired you to write the song\\nthough what was it about was it about a\\nfavorite toy or a boy at school or the\\nfirst song that I really finished and I\\nthink there\\'s a really old horrifying\\ndemo of it floating around on the\\ninternet because naturally there would\\nbe\\num but it\\'s called lucky you and it was\\nthis song that I wrote about a girl\\nwho\\'s different from everybody else and\\nshe\\'s unique and she like sings her own\\nsong and she like goes her own way and\\nshe knows she\\'s different and very 12.\\nit was very 12. it was very uplifting\\nand inspirational and sugar-coated and I\\nlooked back on it and I sounded like a\\nlittle chipmunk singing back then it was\\nso sweet it\\'s a beautiful thing yeah is\\nit kind of one of those things that Mom\\nand Dad bring out at Christmas\\num it\\'s the kind of thing that fans show\\nup with at venues and I\\'m like and they\\nhave like the little CD that I used

like\\ngood Taylor got out there and she did\\nher bit well thank you I guess I I think\\nthat it was so much fun for me when I\\nwas younger that things that felt like\\nwork were like school and studying and\\ndoing projects and doing your homework\\nthat felt like work but for me music was\\njust fun and the fact that I\\'ve been\\nable to pursue something as a career\\nchoice that\\'s just that much fun it\\'s\\nreally cool\\num Taylor we\\'re gonna move on to a first\\nof two quick fire rounds ah this one\\'s\\nclever though because I haven\\'t done one\\nof these in a while so I\\'ve

the worst ones\\nthough and Chicago is a touristy Bank\\nI\\'m so scared and I\\'m just like in this\\nmoment where I\\'m just like oh okay\\nbut yeah it\\'s all better now because\\nobviously I

oh\\nI\\'ve been Googling all night Tyler how\\nterribly inconvenient\\num okay the best day what has been the\\nbest day of your life so far and why Wow\\nthe best day of my life was when\\num on all in one day\\nI found out that\\nmy album had gone\\nback to number one for the 11th week and\\nthat my single love story was number one\\non the pop charts in the U.S and I got\\nto see my first Rolling Stone cover all\\nin one day wow it was such a good day\\nwhat a day that was happening great day\\nfor me incredible day uh Teardrops On My\\nGuitar nice uh when was last time you\\ncried and why the last time I cried was\\num\\nit was\\noh my gosh there was this commercial for\\nWalmart\\nand it was this\\nit was it was a mom and a daughter and\\nthey\\'re like someday you always knew\\nsomeday she would have to go off to\\ncollege and that day you know it\\'s like\\nreally sentimental and there\\'s music\\nplaying in the background and the mom\\ntakes her daughter to college and they\\nget in they get into the dorm room and\\nit\\'s like you know cement floors and\\nlike this just completely plain bear\\nroom with nothing in it and then they go\\nto Walmart and they get all this stuff\\nand they make it all pretty and then um\\nit\\'s like but you can help her prepare\\nfor it and then she walks off and she\\'s\\nwalking out of the dorm thing back to\\nher car to leave her daughter at college\\nand her daughter comes back and it\\'s\\nlike Mom wait and she turns around and\\nthey hug and it\\'s so sweet\\nJesus say that\\n[Laughter]\\nI\\'m just being honest that was the last\\ntime I cried\\nI have some go breaking what you mean\\nit was so cute it was a good commercial\\nthat happened two days ago\\nshall we yes definitely\\n15.\\nwhat was the most outrageous thing you\\ndid when you were 15. oh um when I was\\n15 I\\nI am my best friend and I in high school\\nwe used to dress up in prom dresses and\\njust like go out to eat just and we\\'d\\nrun into other kids from our school and\\nthey\\'d be like why are you wearing a\\ntiara\\nand we\\'re like I did have a good point\\nbecause it\\'s one this Wednesday you know\\nwhat I\\'m saying like why not yeah we\\nused to do stuff like that all the time\\nand it um it really was fun to not\\nreally care too much about what people\\nthought in high school yeah so when I\\nwas 15 I did that I also had my first\\nboyfriend when I was 15 and I just\\nthought it was the coolest thing in the\\nworld was he a nice guy yeah he was\\nreally nice so how was your problem did\\nyou have you had a problem do they still\\nhave food I got a three proms you\\'ve had\\nthree problems yeah I\\'m an addict are\\nthey I\\'ve had to stop going now because\\nI\\'m you know 19 and you should stop at\\nsome point yeah where people think\\nyou\\'re a teacher\\n[Laughter]\\nI\\'ve been spoon fed and I love it\\nAmerican television for so many years\\ngrowing up in the UK so does does the\\nguy hire a limousine and pick you up and\\nput a little flower on your wrist and oh\\nyeah all that stuff actually happens\\nyeah I\\'ve had a bunch of different\\nvariations if you want to talk about\\nprom we\\'ll be here all day like the\\nfirst prom that I went to I went to with\\nmy freshman year boyfriend and he was a\\nsenior and it was so awesome oh my god\\num and I was like really excited about\\num getting this dress and so for months\\nin advance I would be looking for the\\nperfect prom dress and it was a mess of\\nme just like really hyping it up and\\nthen prom came and I was like oh\\njust like a dance okay yeah and then the\\nnext year\\num I didn\\'t have a boyfriend and I\\ndidn\\'t have a date and I was at the\\nmoment unbelievable thank you you think\\nbecause men who intimidated by you they\\ndidn\\'t want to come up to you and go\\nwill you come to the prom with me no\\nright I just you know\\ndidn\\'t get asked\\njust plain and simple I\\'ve come to terms\\nwith that I\\'m cool with it but two days\\nbefore the prom I was at the volleyball\\ncourts and I watched this guy get break\\nbroken up with by his girlfriend and oh\\nhere we go again he sat down next to me\\nand he was like he was like man she\\nbroke up with me I\\'m like I\\'m so sorry\\nhe\\'s like will you get a prom with me\\nand I was like oh he sounds like a\\nkeeper I was like yeah sure and so I\\njust went with a friend the next year\\nand I wore like a 40 dress and just did\\nmy own hair and makeup and that was a\\nreally fun prom the next year I was on\\ntour in my junior year so I was not in\\nschool and I didn\\'t go to prom because I\\nhad a show that night the next year was\\nmy senior year and I also wasn\\'t in\\nschool because I was touring but MTV\\ncame to me and they were like hey let\\'s\\ndo a show about you going to prom with a\\nfan and they had this Nationwide contest\\nas to who was going to go to prom with\\nme and it was on television and it was\\nso much fun that\\'s that is incredible so\\nno one was asking you and then you\\'ve\\ngot the whole nation applying online to\\nbe your date today how much fun is that\\nit was cool I don\\'t expect you to answer\\nthis question I\\'m a gentleman and you\\nare a lady but also as I say being spoon\\nfed the television and the American\\ndream and stuff over the years as a\\nchild after the prom is there a makeout\\npoint is there somewhere you go and\\ndrive in a car and you sit alone and\\nmake out with your dates and stuff does\\nthis happen\\ndays lie to me\\num some people probably do\\nbut I I don\\'t know I never really\\nno I see there were there were parties\\nthat I usually wasn\\'t really invited to\\num so I didn\\'t go to those and\\num I always kind of had a curfew\\nmy parents were really kind of into the\\nwhole curfew thing so\\nI don\\'t know\\nprobably that is the end of the first\\nquickfire round which only took 27\\nminutes\\nthat was superb we do have

notoriously uh unlucky\\nnumber it\\'s really a good number okay\\nyou just people just don\\'t see its full\\npotential\\nI was born on the 13th I turned 13 on\\nFriday the 13th my first album went gold\\nin the U.S in 13 weeks\\num every time I\\'ve won an award at an\\naward show I\\'ve been seated in row M\\nwhich is a 13th letter or like the 13th\\nseat or the 13th row or the 13th section\\num\\nit\\'s all good stuff I might be wrong\\nhere Taylor I\\'m going to lean across the\\nwhole desk all right can I can I smell a\\nlittle bit of OCD about you yeah\\ndefinitely are you counting the rows and\\nmaking the letters\\nyeah to numbers well I like to organize\\nthings I like things to be neat and\\norganized and\\num what month are you born in uh\\nDecember obviously that doesn\\'t make you\\na Virgo I\\'m a Sagittarius is that a\\nSagittarian trait as well I don\\'t know I\\njust think it\\'s um\\nit\\'s just sort of something that\\nhappened to me where I just people are\\nkind of weirded out by it because\\nthey\\'re like well artists are supposed\\nto be disorganized and like disheveled\\nand messy and artsy but for me like when\\nit comes to like putting things together\\nlike it needs to be organized do you\\nhave like do you have to have the jars\\nfacing forward in the cupboards and\\nstuff in the fridge it\\'s not really that\\nbad it it\\'s not like that it\\'s just more\\nof like\\nstructure of just general structure like\\nyeah I\\'ve ruined another quick fire\\naround haven\\'t I sorry it\\'s me I\\'m so\\nsorry okay let\\'s move on uh

favorite piece of\\nclothing Taylor Swift sundresses dresses\\nare my favorite thing in the world like\\nhigh-waisted skirts and tops or dresses\\nI\\'m not I don\\'t pants make me tired for\\nsome reason yeah me too that\\'s why I\\ndon\\'t wear any yeah\\ntrousers yeah\\num what\\'s your who\\'s your favorite\\ndesigner\\num my favorite designer is probably well\\nmy favorite store is Top Shop but my\\nfavorite designer is French Connection\\nthey have really cute dresses let\\'s make\\nsure we say this to Topshop because\\nTyler will never have to buy anything in\\nthere again I\\'m

holiday would probably be\\num\\nprobably be somewhere where it\\'s really\\nhot and\\nBeach Hawaii or Bahamas Hawaii anywhere\\nthey make really great like\\npina colada type deal\\num yeah\\num who\\'s your favorite person my\\nfavorite person is\\num\\nmy mom\\nshe\\'s a really good person beautiful\\nthing she\\'s a great person she\\'s a great\\nchoice for a good person favorite person\\nyeah\\nif you can pick your mum you should\\nalways do so yeah um now in a nut that\\'s\\nthe end of that quick fire round thank\\nyou oh really brilliant yeah we\\'re going\\nto slow things back down again because\\nwe\\'ve been pooping at such a rapid phase\\nso far yes\\num in a nutshell\\num how did you how do you feel you got\\nfrom being a normal teenager to a world\\nSuperstar and kind of work when were you\\nfirst aware that the tides were changing\\nin that direction\\nI think for me like my parents raised me\\nto have the mentality that you\\'re not\\ngoing to get anything unless you work\\nfor it\\num I think my biggest pet peeve is when\\npeople feel like they\\'re entitled to\\nsuccess or things like that so I\\'ve just\\nalways\\nworked really hard played a lot of shows\\ntried to get out in front of as many\\npeople as possible written a lot of\\nsongs always have music floating around\\nin my head bouncing off the sides you\\nknow just like non-stop thinking about\\nmusic\\num I think that possibly helped with\\ngetting me noticed and my family also\\nhas been really wonderful too we moved\\nacross the country to be in Nashville so\\nthat I could be closer to music right\\num and I think that you know to be\\nhonest like writing my own songs and\\nplaying my instrument I think really\\nhelped get me\\nto where I wanted to go faster than I\\nwould have if I hadn\\'t had much of a\\nstory to tell\\num are you at all worried I know that\\nyou know there aren\\'t any kind of well\\ncomparisons really but if we look at\\nsomebody like say Britney Spears and it\\ncould be attributed to the sad state\\nthat she finds herself in now that she\\nhad a lot very young is that something\\nthat you\\'re wary of do you see a kind of\\nlife lesson in Miss Spears and is it\\nsomething and what measures are you\\ntaking to guard against that kind of\\nthing well I think that you know\\neverything in life is is on a\\ncase-by-case basis and you know\\nI think with me\\nI\\'ve tried to surround myself with\\npeople who are going to be really honest\\nwith me whether I like it or not because\\nthere are going to be times when I walk\\nout and I\\'m in a dress that gets vetoed\\nby Mom management everyone around me\\nthey\\'re gonna be like that\\'s too short\\nand you\\'re showing too much and no turn\\naround change clothes and basically I\\nthink that it\\'s all about having people\\naround you that aren\\'t afraid to tell\\nyou no and aren\\'t afraid to tell you\\nsomething you don\\'t want to hear\\num now you\\'re obviously uh very very\\nbusy with your career\\num how do you kind of maintain a balance\\nbetween being Taylor Swift and being a\\n20 year old woman wanting to do 20 year\\nold women things well I just look at\\nlife differently now and I think that\\nyou hear a lot of people complaining\\nabout being celebrities and they\\'re like\\nit\\'s so hard because they can\\'t even go\\nshopping anymore without people asking\\nfor My Autograph all the time and\\neverybody\\'s always staring at me and my\\nlife is so hard people complain about\\nthat you hear people complaining about\\nit a lot and I just feel like\\nyou have to have a perception change\\nwhen your life shifts into the gear of\\neverybody knows who you are\\num\\nyou have to focus on on\\nthinking about it in the perspective of\\nI\\'m gonna go shopping right now\\nit\\'s not going to take the amount of\\ntime that it used to take before people\\nknew who I was it\\'s going to take double\\nand I\\'m cool with that because this is\\nwhat I wanted and I\\'m one of the lucky\\npeople who actually got what they wanted\\nin life and it\\'s it\\'s a good thing you\\nknow you can\\'t look at it as an\\ninconvenience or else you\\'ll feel\\ninconvenienced non-stop like it\\'s so\\nmuch fun for me because when I\\'m driving\\ndown the road in Nashville like people\\nare being dangerous with like like\\ndriving up next to my car with their\\ncamera phone and like trying to drive\\nand trying to take a picture and I\\'m\\nlike oh my God this is so rather just\\npull over do the picture with them so\\neveryone\\'s safe and then just move on oh\\nmy gosh it\\'s amazing it\\'s so much fun\\nfor me like I just find it all to be\\nentertaining it\\'s all fun like it\\'s not\\nhard at all my life is busy but it\\'s not\\nhard you since you signed your record\\ndeal and you know some dollars started\\nto materialize what\\'s your become your\\nbiggest extravagance I try to take care\\nof my band and my crew and just you know\\nfor me that\\'s the most fun thing in the\\nworld you know rather than like buying a\\nLamborghini\\num I just I make sure everyone feels\\nlike they\\'re in the right place you know\\nI make sure that everybody feels like\\nthey\\'re really taken care of and\\num paying them well bonusing them well\\nlike you know just and also like fun\\nthings for me like I like being a good\\nTipper at restaurants okay like I like\\ngiving really good tips and things like\\nthat and just random things that that\\nyou you do because you\\'ve been given a\\nreally really good lot in
