# Data Directory

This directory contains all the data files for the MythTriage project, including gold standard datasets, LLM evaluations, recommendation results, search queries, and search results. As discussed in Ethical Consideration (Section 10) of the paper, we release only video IDs and labels to ensure reproducibility while protecting user privacy and data ethics. To facilitate data hydration, practitioners can reference `/code/data-collection-pipeline/youtube_search_data_pipeline.ipynb` to use the provided video IDs and retrieve their metadata using the YouTube Data API.

## Directory Structure

### `/gold_standard_datasets`
Contains human-annotated datasets used as ground truth for evaluation. 

#### `/myth_specific`

- **`M2_evaluation_set.csv`**: Evaluation dataset for myth category M2 with clinical expert annotations.
- **`M3_evaluation_set.csv`**: Evaluation dataset for myth category M3 with clinical expert annotations.
- **`M4_evaluation_set.csv`**: Evaluation dataset for myth category M4 with clinical expert annotations.
- **`M5_evaluation_set.csv`**: Evaluation dataset for myth category M5 with clinical expert annotations.
- **`M6_evaluation_set.csv`**: Evaluation dataset for myth category M6 with clinical expert annotations.
